# This repo is a reflection of my continuous learning and growth as a Java developer.
This repository contains all the Java programs I practiced over the last couple of weeks as part of strengthening my core software development skills.
During this period, I focused heavily on understanding Core Java, Object-Oriented Programming, Collections, Data Structures & Algorithms, Multithreading alongside hands-on coding exercises.

## What I Practiced & Learned
**1. Core Java Fundamentals**
* Variables, data types
* Scanner-based input handling
* Conditionals & loops
* Methods & static vs instance behavior
* Arrays and ArrayLists
* String manipulation

**2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): I strengthened my understanding on major OOP concepts by implementing Banking System:**
* Class
* Object
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Abstraction

**3. Collections FrameWork**
* List
* ArrayList
* LinkedList

**4. Multithreading**
 Implemented threads using:
* extends Thread
*	implements Runnable
  
	**Understood thread lifecycle Used:**
*	start()
*	run()
*	sleep()
*	join()
  
	**Implemented Producer–Consumer problem using:**
*	wait()
*	notifyAll()
*	synchronized blocks

**5. Data Structures & Algorithms**

Implemented sorting algorithms: Learned how each algorithm works internally, their time complexities.
*	Bubble Sort
*	Selection Sort
*	Insertion Sort
*	Merge Sort
*	Quick Sort
